Description: low-level key/value database for Go, especially CoreOS's etcd
 bbolt is a fork of Ben Johnson's Bolt key/value store
 (github.com/boltdb/bolt).
 .
 The purpose of this fork is to better cater to the needs of CoreOS's etcd
 (github.com/coreos/etcd), and to provide the Go community with an active
 maintenance and development target for Bolt; the goal is improved reliability
 and stability.  bbolt includes bug fixes, performance enhancements, and
 features not found in Bolt while preserving backwards compatibility with the
 Bolt API.
 .
 Bolt is a pure Go key/value store inspired by Howard Chu's and the LMDB
 project. The goal of the project is to provide a simple, fast, and reliable
 database for projects that don't require a full database server such as
 Postgres or MySQL.
